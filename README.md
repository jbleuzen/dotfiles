# Do you dotfiles ?

As I am not an original person, I forked Zach Holman dotfiles to create my own, as he stated in "[Dotfiles are meant to be forked](http://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/)". 
It helps me to have my beloved configuration on every computer I use.

This dotfiles contain only things I use on daily basis, feel free to use every line to create your own.

_Please : don't forget that I am still building my dotfiles._

## Installation

It's easy, it takes five seconds and only five commands :

	git clone
	cd .dot
	rake
	git submodule init
	git submodule update


## Uninstalling

You find something better, no problems enjoy it!
Uninstallation is easy as well, you just need two commands :

	cd ~/.dotfiles
	rake uninstall
